Java annotation processor to generate chained (staged) builders (see [java-builder-pattern-tricks](https://github.com/davidmoten/java-builder-pattern-tricks) for background). Targets JDK 16+ `record` types in particular (but also generates from JDK 8+ classes and interfaces).
* chained builders provide compile-time *type-safety* to ensure mandatory fields are always set
* builders include map, list, and set builders (supporting multiple implementations)
* supports **null-safe** usage (`java.util.Optional` used for optional fields and optional return values)
* supports **null** usage (use `javax.annotation.Nullable` to pass `null` to optional values)
* especially concise usage with java `record` types
* generates builders for `class`, `record` and `interface` types
* supports building from a copy
* supports JDK 8+, Maven, Gradle
* generates source (as well as compiled classes) so is IDE friendly as long as the IDE is *build-helper-maven-plugin* aware.
* no internal class references (no funky stuff, follows public api of javac annotation processor)
* no dedicated support for Jackson or other annotations (just use JDK 16+ `record` and annotate normally!)

## Getting started

### Maven
Make these changes to your `pom.xml`:
* add *chained-api* artifact to the dependencies
* configure *maven-compiler-plugin* to use the *chained-processor* annotation processor
* configure *build-helper-maven-plugin* to ensure generated source is picked up in IDEs and the sources jar

### Gradle
This is how to use *chained* annotation processor in a gradle project (see [here](https://github.com/davidmoten/chained/tree/master/chained-gradle) for a demo minimal project):

**build.gradle** (tested with gradle 8.12.1):
```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
}

// ensure that generated sources end up in the sources jar
tasks.register('sourcesJar', Jar) {
    archiveClassifier.set('sources')
    from sourceSets.main.allSource
    from("$buildDir/generated/sources/annotationProcessor/java/main")
    dependsOn tasks.named('compileJava') 
}

artifacts {
    archives tasks.named('sourcesJar')
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.davidmoten:chained-api:VERSION_HERE'
    annotationProcessor 'com.github.davidmoten:chained-processor:VERSION_HERE'
}
```

## How to build

`mvn clean install`


## Examples
Builders are generated like this:
* fields are detected as parameters on the constructor with the most parameters. If there is more than one constructor with the max number of parameters then the fields are detected from the constructor which has been annotated with `@BuilderConstructor`.
* builder field settter javadoc is extracted for record types from the class-level javadoc
* optional parameters should be typed as `Optional<TYPE_HERE>` or should be annotated with `@Nullable`

#### Null-safe usage
java `record` types are a big boost in concise coding and offer more flexibility than generation from `interface` types. Let's create a builder for the `Person` class below using *chained*, making use of `Optional` for optional fields:

```java
package mine;

import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.annotation.Builder;

@Builder
public final record Person(String name, int yearOfBirth, Optional<String> comments) {}
```
Using defaults this will generate the `mine.builder.PersonBuilder` ([src](https://github.com/davidmoten/chained/blob/master/src/main/docs/PersonBuilder.java))

We can use it like this:

```java
Person p = PersonBuilder
    .builder()
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .comments("enjoyed the event")
    .build();
```
From a discoverability perspective this is not great because a user has to know of the existence of `PersonBuilder`. Let's improve this by adding a static builder method to `Person` class:

```java
package mine;

import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.annotation.Builder;
import mine.builder.PersonBuilder.BuilderWithName;

@Builder
public final record Person(String name, int yearOfBirth, Optional<String> comments) {
    public static BuilderWithName name(String name) {
        return PersonBuilder.builder().name(name);
    }
}
```
Now we create a `Person` like this:
```java
Person p = Person
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .comments("enjoyed the event")
    .build();
```
We've knocked out the `.builder()` call (`name` is mandatory so always has to be specified, forced at compile time), and we have discoverability back (because the creation of `Person` is via a factory method on the `Person` class). 

It's very convenient for us that the annotation processor being run by the maven compiler plugin can do this. `javac` hands java structures parsed from source to the annotation processor and doesn't check that all references to classes actually exist till multi-round annotation processing (generation) has finished.

Note that the `comments` field is optional and these are our creation options in the builder due to the existence of method overrides:

```java
// leave comments out
Person a = Person
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .build();

// pass empty comments
Person a = Person
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .comments(Optional.empty())
    .build();

// pass comments
Person a = Person
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .comments("cool person")
    .build();

// pass wrapped comments
Person a = Person
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .comments(Optional.of("cool person"))
    .build();
```

#### Nullable usage
Let's create a builder for the `Person` class below using *chained*, making use of `null` for optional fields:

```java
package mine;

import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.annotation.Builder;
import javax.annotation.Nullable;

@Builder
public final record Person(String name, int yearOfBirth, @Nullable String comments) {}
```
Using defaults this will generate the class `mine.builder.PersonBuilder`.

We can use it like this:

```java
Person p = PersonBuilder
    .builder()
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .comments("enjoyed the event")
    .build();
```
From a discoverability perspective this is not great because a user has to know of the existence of `PersonBuilder`. Let's improve this by adding a static builder method to `Person` class (it's easiest to do this after having generated the builder once so the IDE is aware of available classes):

```java
package mine;

import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.annotation.Builder;
import javax.annotation.Nullable;
import mine.builder.PersonBuilder.BuilderWithName;

@Builder
public final record Person(String name, int yearOfBirth, @Nullable String comments) {
    public static BuilderWithName name(String name) {
        return PersonBuilder.builder().name(name);
    }
}
```
Now we create a `Person` like this:
```java
Person p = Person
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .comments("enjoyed the event")
    .build();
```
We've knocked out the `.builder()` call (`name` is mandatory so always has to be specified, forced at compile time), and we have discoverability back (because the creation of `Person` is via a factory method on the `Person` class). 

It's very convenient for us that the annotation processor being run by the maven compiler plugin can do this. `javac` hands java structures parsed from source to the annotation processor and doesn't check that all references to classes actually exist till multi-round annotation processing (generation) has finished.

Note that the `comments` field is optional and these are our creation options in the builder:

```java
// leave comments out
Person a = Person
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .build();

// pass empty comments
Person a = Person
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .comments(null)
    .build();

// pass comments
Person a = Person
    .name("Helen")
    .yearOfBirth(2001)
    .comments("cool person")
    .build();
```
### Shortcutting the `build` method
If all parameters are mandatory then the default generated builder provides the built object from the setter of the last parameter:
```java
@Builder
public record Point(int x, int y) {
    public static BuilderWithX x(int x) {
        return PointBuilder.builder().x(x);
    } 
}
```
Usage:
```java
Point point = Point.x(12).y(22);
```
If you don't want  to shortcut the `build` method then set the annotation as `@Builder(alwaysIncludeBuildMethod = true)`. If you do this then usage will be
```java
Point point = Point.x(12).y(22).build();
```

### Copy 
Let's look at the `Person` record example again, and we'll add a `copy` method:

```java
package mine;

import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.annotation.Builder;
import mine.builder.PersonBuilder.BuilderWithName;
import mine.builder.PersonBuilder.CopyBuilder;

@Builder
public final record Person(String name, int yearOfBirth, Optional<String> comments) {
    public static BuilderWithName name(String name) {
        return PersonBuilder.builder().name(name);
    }
    
    public CopyBuilder copy() {
        return PersonBuilder.copy(this);
    }
}
```
Now we can do this:

```java
Person a = Person.name("fred").age(23).build();

Person b = a.copy().withName("anne").build();
```

Of course you can do this without adding the `copy` method too:

```java
Person a = Person.name("fred").age(23).build();

Person b = PersonBuilder.copy(a).withName("anne").build();
```

### Providing the full class name of the generated classes

Set the value of the `@Builder` annotation to customize the full generated class name. The value can be templated with these items:
* `${pkg}` - the package of the class with the `@Builder` annotation
* `${simpleName}` - the simple name of the class with the `@Builder` annotation
The default value is `${pkg}.builder.${simpleName}Builder`.

For example if you want the generated builder class to be in the same package:
```java
package mine;

import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.annotation.Builder;

@Builder("${pkg}.${simpleName}Builder")
public final record Person(String name, int yearOfBirth, Optional<String> comments) {}
```

### Generating from interface types
This generation method is especially useful for JDKs before JDK 16 (when `record` type was introduced).

```java
package mine;

import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.annotation.Builder;
import mine.builder.PersonBuilder.BuilderWithName;

@Builder
public interface Person {

    String name();
    int yearOfBirth();
    Optional<String> description();
    
    public static BuilderWithName name(String name) {
        return PersonBuilder.builder().name(name);
    }
}
```
This generation method generates `PersonBuilder` class and also a `PersonImpl` class next to it. The returned instance of `Person` from the builder is actually an instance of `PersonImpl`.

If you want to validate the fields add a `default` method annotated with `@Check`:

```java
package mine;

import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.Preconditions;
import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.annotation.Builder;
import com.github.davidmoten.chained.api.annotation.Check;
import mine.builder.PersonBuilder.BuilderWithName;

@Builder
public interface Person {

    String name();
    int yearOfBirth();
    Optional<String> description();
    
    @Check
    default void check() {
        Preconditions.checkArgument(name().trim().length() > 0, "name cannot be blank");
        Preconditions.checkArgument(yearOfBirth() > 1900, "yearOfBirth must be after 1900");
        Preconditions.checkArgument(
            description()
                .map(x -> x.length)
                .orElse(0) < 4096,
            "description must be less than 4096 characters");
    }
    
    public static BuilderWithName name(String name) {
        return PersonBuilder.builder().name(name);
    }
}

```

### Generating from class types

```java
@Builder
public final class Point2 { 
    
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    public Point2(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public static BuilderWithX x(int x) {
        return Point2Builder.builder().x(x);
    }
    
    public int x() {
        return x;
    }
    
    public int y() {
        return y;
    }
}
```
After generating the builder for the class the static `x(int x)` method was added. We build an instance of `Point2` like this:
```java
Point2 p = Point2.x(123).y(456);
```
The above class example is immutable but you can also generate a class for a mutable class (say with a no-args constructor even). However, you do have to ensure that an all-args constructor is present for the generator to find fields. 

The all-args constructor can be private by the way (which allows the coder to ensure that creation occurs through the builder only).

### Javadoc

#### Records
Java `record` types (like example below), don't support method-level (getter) javadoc so all parameter javadoc is at the class level.
```java
/**
 * Represents a point in 2D space.
 *
 * @param x the x-coordinate of the point
 * @param y the y-coordinate of the point
 */
public record Point(int x, int y) {}
```
*chained* copies over the parameter javadoc to the builder methods so that they look like:
```java
    /**
     * Sets the x-coordinate of the point.
     * 
     * @param x the x-coordinate of the point
     * @return builder
     */
    public BuilderWithX x(@Nonnull int x) {
        this.x = x;
        return new BuilderWithX(this);
    }
    ...
    /**
     * Sets the y-coordinate of the point.
     * 
     * @param y the y-coordinate of the point
     * @return built Point
     */
    public Point y(@Nonnull int y) {
        _b.y = y;
        return _b.build();
    }    
```


### Map builders

Fields that are declared with the types below will have corresponding map builders:
* `java.util.Map`
* `java.util.HashMap`
* `java.util.SortedMap`
* `java.util.NavigableMap`
* `java.util.TreeMap`
* `java.util.LinkedHashMap`

For example, given this class:
```java
@Builder
public record HasProperties(String name, Map<String, String> properties) {
    public static HasProperties name(String name) {
        return HasPropertiesBuilder.builder().name();
    }
}
```
we can assign the map in one go:

```java
Map<String, String> properties = Map.of("scars", "true", "yearOfBirth", "2000");
HasProperties a = HasProperties
    .name("jack")
    .properties(properties);
```

or more fluidly:

```java
HasProperties a = HasProperties
    .name("jack") 
    .properties()
    .put("scars", "true")
    .put("yearOfBirth", "2000")
    .buildMap();
```

### List builders

Fields that are declared with the types below will have corresponding list builders:
* `java.util.List`
* `java.util.ArrayList`
* `java.util.LinkedList`

For example, given this class:

```java
@Builder
public record HasNumbers(String name, List<T> numbers) {
    public static HasProperties name(String name) {
        return HasPropertiesBuilder.builder().name();
    }
}
```
we can assign the list in one go:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3);
HasNumbers a = HasNumbers
    .name("jack")
    .numbers(numbers);
```

or more fluidly:

```java
HasNumbers a = HasNumbers
    .name("jack") 
    .numbers()
    .add(1, 2)
    .add(3)
    .buildList();
```

### Set builders

Fields that are declared with the types below will have corresponding set builders:
* `java.util.Set`
* `java.util.HashSet`
* `java.util.LinkedHashSet`
* `java.util.SortedSet`
* `java.util.TreeSet`

For example, given this class:
```java
@Builder
public record HasNumbers(String name, Set<T> numbers) {
    public static HasProperties name(String name) {
        return HasPropertiesBuilder.builder().name();
    }
}
```
we can assign the set in one go:

```java
Set<Integer> numbers = Set.of(1, 2, 3);
HasNumbers a = HasNumbers
    .name("jack")
    .numbers(numbers);
```

or more fluidly:

```java
HasNumbers a = HasNumbers
    .name("jack") 
    .numbers()
    .add(1, 2)
    .add(3)
    .buildList();
```

### Modelling patterns
These are some aspects of modelling that you may want to represent:
* field constraints (like OpenAPI `min`, `max`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`)
* field defaults (when a value is not specified)
* field transformations

### How to implement field constraints
Use the constructor for `record` and `class` types, and the `@Check` annotation for `interface` types.

An example with a `record` type:

```java
public Person(String name, int yearOfBirth) {
    public Person {
        Preconditions.checkArgument(yearOfBirth >= 1900, "yearOfBirth must be >= 1900");
    }
}
```
See [Generating from interface types](#generating-from-interface-types) for an example of using `@Check`.

#### How to implement field defaults and transformations
Modify field inputs in the constructor for `record` and `class` types, not available for `interface` types (but there are workarounds).

A field default example with a `record` type:

```java
public Order(String id, Optional<Integer> number) {
    public Order {
        if (number.isEmpty()) {
            number = Optional.of(1);
        }
    }
}
```

This is also achievable with the `interface` type but not as cleanly because we choose to expose two `number` accessors in the public API:

```java
public interface Order {
    String id();
    
    Optional<Integer> numberInput();
    
    default int number() {
        return numberInput().orElse(1);
    }
}
```
## Motivation
Here's a comparison of Chained with [Immutables](https://immutables.github.io), [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value) and [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) tools.

**Fluent, Readable API**
* Chained focuses specifically on generating fluent builder patterns with concise, readable chaining methods.
* While Immutables and AutoValue provide builders, Chained is explicitly designed around the idea of fluent method chaining, making it extremely intuitive and easy to read.
* Lombok does generate builders, but the chaining style and flexibility provided by Chained specifically targets readability and intuitive construction.
  
**Lightweight and Minimalistic**
* Chained is intentionally lightweight, generating minimal, predictable code. It avoids complex feature sets and thus remains simple and straightforward.
* Immutables and AutoValue offer rich feature sets that may include additional complexity (like JSON serialization, derived attributes, modifiable types).
* Lombok has a wide scope, generating diverse boilerplate code (getters, setters, equals/hashCode, etc.) beyond just builders, which adds complexity in debugging and IDE integration.
  
**Explicit and Transparent Generated Code**
* Chained produces clear, maintainable, and predictable generated code. Its explicit builder patterns help developers quickly grasp object construction logic.
* Unlike Lombok, which can obscure generated code in IDEs and cause transparency and debugging challenges, Chained ensures that the generated builders are straightforward and easy to inspect.
* Immutables and AutoValue also generate explicit code, but Chained positions itself as simpler and more focused on builders alone.

**Optimized for Modern Java (Records and Immutable Types)**
* Chained is well-suited to modern Java features like records and immutable data types, providing easy integration and support without complex configuration or dependency management.
* Immutables and AutoValue also support modern Java, but they require more elaborate setup and configuration.
* Lombok’s support for records and newer Java features is evolving but can lag behind or require additional steps to integrate effectively.
  
**Low Barrier to Adoption**
* Chained provides a minimal and straightforward annotation processing model, making it easy to integrate into existing projects without extensive setup or dependency management.
* Immutables and AutoValue require more elaborate setup and learning curve.
* Lombok, while popular, may introduce IDE and build configuration complexity, as it integrates deeply into the compilation process and IDE tooling.

### Summary of When to Prefer Chained
* You value simplicity, readability, and explicitness in builder code generation.
* You want minimalism and ease of integration without extensive setup or advanced feature overhead.
* You're using modern Java features like records and immutable types, and you prefer a solution directly tailored to this context.
* You want to avoid the complexity, opacity, IDE integration problems, or maintenance overhead associated with broader and more complex code-generation tools like Lombok, Immutables, and AutoValue.
In short, Chained provides a lightweight, modern, fluent, and explicitly readable solution specifically optimized for generating chained builders, offering a simpler alternative to the richer, but more complex ecosystems of Immutables, Lombok, and AutoValue.
